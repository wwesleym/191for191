### pom.xml

Maven gets all its settings from a file called `pom.xml`. This file determines the dependencies we will use in our project as well as the plugins we use for compiling, testing, building, ect..

 - [pom.xml](pom.xml)
No Idea what this does but i did see it somewhere in the files we have so hopefully something happens

## Notes
Andrew Kim: I used XAMPP Control Panel as a localhost and tested it there. I had to put all the files into a folder named 191for191-main. When I installed it the place I put the files was C:\xampp\htdocs\191for191-main. Then using http://localhost/191for191-main/createproject.html I added data to the table through using the form.

### Help
I personally have no idea what this is going on so this is a placeholder.

### JsonInclude
Up to this point we have almost not much to show but will work on later.
  
### Result
Hopefully we add stuff to the database and get things out of it too.

# Endpoints
Here is where the endpoints are: [/backend](/backend/README.md)
